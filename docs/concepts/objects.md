# The Router object

This object manages application routes. A _route_ has three parts: a method, a URI path, and a callback. The Router object dispatches the current HTTP request to the first matching application route (or to the appropriate error handler). The Router can be accessed directly, but it is typically used via proxy methods on the application instance.
